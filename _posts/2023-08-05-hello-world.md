## Hello world!

This is my first blog post.

I am writing in Markdown.

Markdown is a language that's basically just plain text with some useful shortcuts to make it easy for computers to process in an aesthetic way.

### "Markdown" Madness Examples
#### What are Markdown files?
They're files that end in `.md`. That's the magic file ending, and the computer can take it from there to format the text.

#### Headers
Did you see `Headers` is bolded just above? That's part of the magic of Markdown. I only wrote this: 
```markdown
#### Headers
```
But _Github's Markdown engineâ„¢_ can convert that line into a bold Header.

The number of hashtags before the text determines how big the header will be on the page.
My `Hello world` header/title at the top has two hashtags before it in my Markdown file (ie `## Hello world!`).
#### I still don't get it ...

That's okay. Maybe check out these resources:
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown [a little technical and long but definitely informative]
- https://youtu.be/qhoXn4bIE1s [a six minute video on Markdown]

Here's a _clickable_ screenshot of what my Markdown looks like, and you can flip back and forth between that text and what you see on your screen for more context.

That's all for now on Markdown. Now, let's get into the mathemagic.
