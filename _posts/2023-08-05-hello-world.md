## Hello world!

This is my first blog post.

I am writing in Markdown.

Markdown is a language that's basically just plain text with some useful shortcuts to make it easy for computers to process in an aesthetic way.

### "Markdown" Madness Examples
#### What are Markdown files?
They're files that end in `.md`. That's the magic file ending, and the computer can take it from there to format the text.

#### Headers
Did you see `Headers` is specially styled just above? That's part of the magic of Markdown. I only wrote this: 
```
#### Headers
```
But _Github's Markdown engineâ„¢_ can convert that line into a styled Header.

The number of hashtags before the text determines how big the header will be on the page.
My `Hello world` header/title at the top has two hashtags before it in my Markdown file (ie `## Hello world!`).
#### I still don't get it ...

That's okay. Maybe check out these resources:
- [a little technical and long but definitely informative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)
- [a six minute video on Markdown](https://youtu.be/qhoXn4bIE1s)

And, here's what my Markdown looks like, and you can flip back=and-forth between that text and what you see on your screen for more context.
